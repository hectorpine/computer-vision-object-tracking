# Deep SORT
## YOLOv3 Network
Generating the bounding boxes for detected objects


## Detections
Encode given cropped image


## Kalman Filter
Used to generate predictions of objects' future locations

## IoU Matching
Solve linear assignment problem as well as cascade matching

## Nearest Neighbor Matching
Solves cosine distance and Eucladian distance for Deep Appearance Descriptor as well as Kalman filter

## Tracking
Combines modules to create final object

## Object Tracking
Complete and run algorithm in a loop for each video.
